PGEforge is a community-driven platform designed to simplify *Plasmodium* genomic data analysis. The process of analyzing genomic data often involves various software tools with different formats, user interfaces, and levels of accessibility. These differences can create barriers, especially for those without strong computational skills.

PGEforge aims to overcome these challenges by providing clear tutorials, streamlined workflows, and comprehensive resources to help researchers at all levels understand and analyze genomic data. By prioritizing the end-user, we strive to encourage better software development and foster an inclusive research community. Our goal is to make advanced genomic analysis accessible to everyone, promoting collaboration and accelerating progress in malaria research.\

## The PGEforge platform
All of the resources for enhancing **P**lasmodium **G**enomic **E**pidemiology analysis are found on our open-source [website](https://mrc-ide.github.io/PGEforge/).
