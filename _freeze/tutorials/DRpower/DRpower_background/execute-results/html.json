It can be used in two main ways:\n\n1. **In the design phase of a study** to perform power and sample size calculations. To tell us how many sites we need to recruit, and how many samples per site.\n2. **In the analysis phase of a study** to estimate the prevalence of the marker of interest and optionally to compare this value against a set threshold.\n\nThe approach uses a Bayesian model to estimate the prevalence, which takes into account the potential of intra-cluster correlation in multi-site studies.\n\n## Existing resources\n\n- The [*DRpower* website](https://mrc-ide.github.io/DRpower/) gives details of the statistical arguments behind the tool as well as installation instructions and worked tutorials for both design and analysis phases.\n- The [*pfhrp2/3* Planner](https://shiny.dide.ic.ac.uk/DRpower-app/) provides a web-based interface to the  *DRpower* tool. It does not have all the functionality of the R package, but can be used to carry out simple design and analysis tasks in a user-friendly way.\n\n## Citation\n\nPlease use the following citation:\n\n```\n@Manual{,\n    title = {DRpower: Study design and analysis for pfhrp2/3 deletion prevalence studies},\n    author = {Bob Verity and Shazia Ruybal},\n    note = {R package version 1.0.2},\n  }\n```",
