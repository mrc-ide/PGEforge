  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Targeted next-generation sequencing offers the
              potential for consistent, deep coverage of information-rich
              genomic regions to characterize polyclonal Plasmodium falciparum
              infections. However, methods to identify and sequence these
              genomic regions are currently limited. METHODS: A bioinformatic
              pipeline and multiplex methods were developed to identify and
              simultaneously sequence 100 targets and applied to dried blood
              spot (DBS) controls and field isolates from Mozambique. For
              comparison, whole-genome sequencing data were generated for the
              same controls. RESULTS: Using publicly available genomes, 4465
              high-diversity genomic regions suited for targeted sequencing
              were identified, representing the P. falciparum heterozygome. For
              this study, 93 microhaplotypes with high diversity (median
              expected heterozygosity = 0.7) were selected along with 7 drug
              resistance loci. The sequencing method achieved very high
              coverage (median 99\%), specificity (99.8\%), and sensitivity
              (90\% for haplotypes with 5\% within sample frequency in dried
              blood spots with 100 parasites/ÂµL). In silico analyses revealed
              that microhaplotypes provided much higher resolution to
              discriminate related from unrelated polyclonal infections than
              biallelic single-nucleotide polymorphism barcodes. CONCLUSIONS:
              The bioinformatic and laboratory methods outlined here provide a
              flexible tool for efficient, low-cost, high-throughput
              interrogation of the P. falciparum genome, and can be tailored to
              simultaneously address multiple questions of interest in various
              epidemiological settings.",

               malaria recognize histidine-rich protein 2 antigen. Plasmodium
               falciparum parasites lacking histidine-rich protein 2 (pfhrp2)
               and 3 (pfhrp3) genes escape detection by these RDTs, but it is
               not known whether these deletions confer sufficient selective
               advantage to drive rapid population expansion. By studying blood
               samples from a cohort of 12,572 participants enroled in a
               prospective, cross-sectional survey along Ethiopia's borders
               with Eritrea, Sudan and South Sudan using RDTs, PCR, an
               ultrasensitive bead-based immunoassay for antigen detection and
               next-generation sequencing, we estimate that histidine-rich
               protein 2-based RDTs would miss 9.7\% (95\% confidence interval
               8.5--11.1) of P. falciparum malaria cases owing to pfhrp2
               deletion. We applied a molecular inversion probe-targeted deep
               sequencing approach to identify distinct subtelomeric deletion
               patterns and well-established pfhrp3 deletions and to uncover
               recent expansion of a singular pfhrp2 deletion in all regions
               sampled. We propose a model in which pfhrp3 deletions have
               arisen independently multiple times, followed by strong positive
               selection for pfhrp2 deletion owing to RDT-based
               test-and-treatment. Existing diagnostic strategies need to be
               urgently reconsidered in Ethiopia, and improved surveillance for
               pfhrp2 deletion is needed throughout the Horn of Africa. A
               prospective, cross-sectional survey of 12,572 participants in
               Ethiopia reveals that malaria diagnostics miss almost 10\% of
               cases owing to a gene deletion in Plasmodium falciparum that is
               under positive selection.",

               individuals between endemic areas undermines local
               interventions. Quantifying parasite importation has therefore
               become a priority for national control programs. We analyzed
               epidemiological surveillance data, travel surveys, parasite
               genetic data, and anonymized mobile phone data to measure the
               spatial spread of malaria parasites in southeast Bangladesh. We
               developed a genetic mixing index to estimate the likelihood of
               samples being local or imported from parasite genetic data and
               inferred the direction and intensity of parasite flow between
               locations using an epidemiological model integrating the travel
               survey and mobile phone calling data. Our approach indicates
               that, contrary to dogma, frequent mixing occurs in low
               transmission regions in the southwest, and elimination will
               require interventions in addition to reducing imported
               infections from forested regions. Unlike risk maps generated
               from clinical case counts alone, therefore, our approach
               distinguishes areas of frequent importation as well as high
