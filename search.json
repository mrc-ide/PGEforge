Here, we have used the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate as out point estimate, but other options are available (see ?get_prevalence).\nWe can also produce a simple plot of the posterior distribution of the prevalence:\n\n# plot the posterior distribution of the prevalence\nplot_prevalence(n = df_Tigray$Num_pfhrp2_deleted,\n                N = df_Tigray$Num_pfhrp2_tested)\n\n\n\n\nNotice that both the table output and the plot give a probability close to 100% of being above the 5% threshold.

    "text": "Estimating the intra-cluster correlation\nA second quantity that we might be interested in is the level of intra-cluster correlation. This tells us whether the prevalence is consistent between sites (low ICC) or highly variable between sites (high ICC). A high ICC can be caused by many factors, including a patchy geographic distribution in the prevalence of deletions within the province. Not only is this interesting information in itself, it also provides extremely useful context for future studies in the same region or neighbouring regions.\nWe can estimate the ICC using the get_ICC() function:\n\n# estimate the ICC\nget_ICC(n = df_Tigray$Num_pfhrp2_deleted,\n        N = df_Tigray$Num_pfhrp2_tested)\n\n     MAP CrI_lower CrI_upper\n1 0.0151         0    0.1031\n\n\nOur point estimate of the ICC is around 0.015. This is below the 0.05 value that we typically assume based on analysis of historical data, which may imply that the prevalence of pfhrp2 deletions is relatively flat in the Tigray province. However, we can also see that the 95% CrI ranges from 0 to 0.103, and so we do not have very strong information here.\nAs with prevalence, we can produce a simple plot of the posterior distribution of ICC:\n\n# plot the posterior distribution of the ICC\nplot_ICC(n = df_Tigray$Num_pfhrp2_deleted,\n         N = df_Tigray$Num_pfhrp2_tested)\n\n\n\n\nFinally, if we really want to understand how prevalence and ICC relate to each other, we can plot the joint distribution of both parameters. Here, we have set the breaks in both the x- and y-dimensions to focus in on the region of interest:\n\n# joint plot of prevalence and ICC\nplot_joint(n = df_Tigray$Num_pfhrp2_deleted,\n           N = df_Tigray$Num_pfhrp2_tested,\n           prev_breaks = seq(0.1, 0.3, l = 101),\n           ICC_breaks = seq(0, 0.1, l = 101))\n\n\n\n\nThis shows that there are no strong correlations between parameters, but honestly this is probably more information than we need most of the time."

We are highly confident that this prevalence is above the WHO threshold of 5%. We find evidence that the intra-cluster correlation may be low in this region (0.015, CrI 0.00-0.103), implying that the prevalence of pfhrp2 deletions may be relatively flat. Finally, in a retrospective power analysis we identify that this was a well-powered study, giving us increased confidence in the conclusions."

    "text": "SP mutation prevalence - margin of error (MoE) calculation\nOur plan is to pool results over the 3 sites within each province to arrive at an estimate of the overall prevalence of SP mutations at the province level. When pooling results it is important to take account of intra-cluster correlation (ICC) in our confidence intervals (CIs). Failure to do so will lead to unrealistically tight intervals. DRpower provides several functions for calculating the expected margin of error (MoE) given assumptions about sample size, the ICC, and the known prevalence of mutations.\nFirst, let’s load the package and set the random seed so our results are reproducible:\n\nlibrary(DRpower)\nset.seed(1)\n\nWe will use the get_margin() function to tell us the MoE we can expect if the prevalence of a mutation is 10% at the province level. We set the parameters to define 3 clusters of 100 samples. We assume an ICC value of 0.05:\n\n# get MoE using simple calculation\nget_margin(N = 100, n_clust = 3, prevalence = 0.1, ICC = 0.05)\n\n    lower     upper \n 1.719297 18.280703 \n\n\nThis output tells us that we expect our CI to range from 1.7% at the lower end to 18.3% at the upper end when estimating a variant at 10% prevalence. In other words, we expect a MoE of 8.3%. This is precise enough for most purposes.\nOur worst case MoE will occur when the prevalence of the marker is 50%. We can explore this here:\n\n# get worst case MoE\nget_margin(N = 100, n_clust = 3, prevalence = 0.5, ICC = 0.05)\n\n   lower    upper \n36.19883 63.80117 \n\n\nIn the worst case our MoE goes up to \\(\\pm\\) 14%, which is still reasonably precise.\nHowever, this approach assumes that we know the level of intra-cluster correlation exactly. It also uses a normal approximation when producing CIs, which is a bad approximation when the prevalence is very low or very high. A more cautious approach is to estimate prevalence using the Bayesian model within DRpower. If we plan to use this approach, then we should use the get_margin_Bayesian() function to estimate the MoE:\n\n# get expected MoE via the Bayesian approach\nget_margin_Bayesian(N = rep(100, 3), prevalence = 0.1, reps = 1e2)\n\n      estimate    CI_2.5   CI_97.5\nlower   3.8705  3.391827  4.349173\nupper  25.1018 23.891353 26.312247\n\n\nWe should look at the first column of this data.frame when comparing to the previous values. We now find that our credible interval (CrI) is expected to range from 3.8% to 25.1%. This is quite different from what we found under the simpler get_margin() method, being tighter at low prevalence but wider at high prevalence. Note that unlike the previous function these are estimated values, hence they are presented along with a 95% CI. We can make estimate more precise if needed by increasing reps.\nWe can explore our worst case MoE using the same method:\n\n# get worst case MoE via the Bayesian approach\nget_margin_Bayesian(N = rep(100, 3), prevalence = 0.5, reps = 1e2)\n\n      estimate   CI_2.5  CI_97.5\nlower  33.4947 31.92120 35.06820\nupper  65.5736 64.12608 67.02112\n\n\nIn the worst case we can expect our CI to range from 33.5% to 66.6%, a MoE of around \\(\\pm\\) 16.5%. This is slightly higher than before, but still precise enough for most purposes."

    "text": "pfkelch13 mutations - presence/absence analysis\nWhen it comes to pfkelch13, we are interested in knowing if there are any mutants in the province, rather than estimating the prevalence of mutants. A single positive sample would prove that there are mutants in the province, however, if the prevalence is very low we may get unlucky and miss them. We can use the get_power_presence() function to explore our probability of detecting at least one positive sample:\n\n# get power when prevalence is 1%\nget_power_presence(N = rep(100, 3), prevalence = 0.01, ICC = 0.05)\n\n[1] 65.38844\n\n\nWe can see that if pfkelch13 mutants were at 1% prevalence at the province level then we would have a 65% chance of detecting one in any of our 3 sites. This is quite low power - we normally aim for at least 80%. Compare that to the result if we assume mutants are at 2% in the province:\n\n# get power when prevalence is 2%\nget_power_presence(N = rep(100, 3), prevalence = 0.02, ICC = 0.05)\n\n[1] 88.08013\n\n\nWe now have close to 90% power. So, we can say we are powered to detect rare variants down to around 2% prevalence, but if they are less common than this we risk missing them. Whether or not this is an acceptable level of sensitivity is a programmatic decision."

    "text": "pfhrp2/3 deletions - comparison against 5% threshold\nWe plan to follow the WHO Master Protocol, switching RDTs at a national level if any province has a prevalence of pfhrp2/3 deletions significantly over 5%. We can use the get_power_threshold() function to calculate our power under this model. We assume here that the prevalence of deletions at the province level is 10%:\n\n# estimate power under WHO approach\nget_power_threshold(N = rep(100, 3), prevalence = 0.1, prev_thresh = 0.05, ICC = 0.05, reps = 1e3)\n\n  prev_thresh power lower upper\n1        0.05  59.9 56.79 62.95\n\n\nWe only have around 60% power under this design. We would obtain a higher power if we assumed the prevalence of pfhrp2/3 deletions was higher than 10%, but we would need to be able to justify this assumption with evidence - for example results of a pilot study, or results from neighbouring countries.\nIn our case, we will instead abandon the threshold comparison approach in favour of a two-step design. Our new plan will be to look for the presence of any pfhrp2/3 deletions at the province level, and only if they are detected we will perform a follow-up study in that province. The nice thing about this is that we have already performed this power calculation, as it becomes a presence/absence analysis exactly as we did for pfkelch13. We therefore know that we have power to detect single deletions down to around 2% prevalence.\nFor our follow-up study, we can explore what would happen if we doubled the number of sites in a province:\n\n# estimate power with 6 sites of 100\nget_power_threshold(N = rep(100, 6), prevalence = 0.1, prev_thresh = 0.05, ICC = 0.05, reps = 1e3)\n\n  prev_thresh power lower upper\n1        0.05  78.4 75.72 80.91\n\n\nWe find that power is around 79%, which is acceptable. We will therefore go ahead with this two-stage design."
