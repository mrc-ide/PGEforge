  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Molecular markers, particularly those associated with
              drug resistance, are important surveillance tools that can inform
              policy choice. People infected with falciparum malaria often
              contain several genetically-distinct clones of the parasite;
              genotyping the patients' blood reveals whether or not the marker
              is present (i.e. its prevalence), but does not reveal its
              frequency. For example a person with four malaria clones may
              contain both mutant and wildtype forms of a marker but it is not
              possible to distinguish the relative frequencies of the mutant
              and wildtypes i.e. 1:3, 2:2 or 3:1. METHODS: An appropriate
              method for obtaining frequencies from prevalence data is by
              Maximum Likelihood analysis. A computer programme has been
              developed that allows the frequency of markers, and haplotypes
              defined by up to three codons, to be estimated from blood
              phenotype data. RESULTS: The programme has been fully documented
              [see Additional File 1] and provided with a user-friendly
              interface suitable for large scale analyses. It returns accurate
              frequencies and 95\% confidence intervals from simulated dataset
              sets and has been extensively tested on field data sets.
              CONCLUSION: The programme is included [see Additional File 2]
              and/or may be freely downloaded from 1. It can then be used to
              extract molecular marker and haplotype frequencies from their
              prevalence in human blood samples. This should enhance the use of
              frequency data to inform antimalarial drug policy choice.",
