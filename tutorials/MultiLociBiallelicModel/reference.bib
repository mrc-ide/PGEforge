  abstract = "The introduction of genomic methods facilitated standardized
              molecular disease surveillance. For instance, SNP barcodes in
              Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum malaria allows the
              characterization of haplotypes, their frequencies and prevalence
              to reveal temporal and spatial transmission patterns. A
              confounding factor is the presence of multiple genetically
              distinct pathogen variants within the same infection, known as
              multiplicity of infection (MOI). Disregarding ambiguous
              information, as usually done in ad-hoc approaches, leads to less
              confident and biased estimates. We introduce a statistical
              framework to obtain maximum-likelihood estimates (MLE) of
              haplotype frequencies and prevalence alongside MOI from malaria
              SNP data, i.e., multiple biallelic marker loci. The number of
              model parameters increases geometrically with the number of
              genetic markers considered and no closed-form solution exists for
              the MLE. Therefore, the MLE needs to be derived numerically. We
              use the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to derive the
              maximum-likelihood estimates, an efficient and easy-to-implement
              algorithm that yields a numerically stable solution. We also
              derive expressions for haplotype prevalence based on either all
              or just the unambiguous genetic information and compare both
              approaches. The latter corresponds to a biased ad-hoc estimate of
              prevalence. We assess the performance of our estimator by
              systematic numerical simulations assuming realistic sample sizes
              and various scenarios of transmission intensity. For reasonable
              sample sizes, and number of loci, the method has little bias. As
              an example, we apply the method to a dataset from Cameroon on
              sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance in P. falciparum malaria.
              The method is not confined to malaria and can be applied to any
              infectious disease with similar transmission behavior. An
              easy-to-use implementation of the method as an R-script is
              provided.",
