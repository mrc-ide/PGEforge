## Installation from Github 
In order to run the [THE REAL McCOIL](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005348), we will use an R wrapper, [McCOILR](https://github.com/OJWatson/McCOILR) by OJ Watson that encapsulates the code from the [EPPIcenter GitHub](https://github.com/EPPIcenter/THEREALMcCOIL).

```{r, eval=F}
library(remotes)
remotes::install_github("OJWatson/McCOILR")
```
