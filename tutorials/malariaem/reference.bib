  abstract = "Characterizing genetic variability in the human pathogenic
              Plasmodium species, the group of parasites that cause Malaria,
              may have broad global health implications. Specifically,
              discerning the combinations of mutations that lead to viable
              parasites and the population level frequencies of these clonal
              sequences will allow for targeted vaccine development and
              individualized treatment choices. This presents an analytical
              challenge, however, since haplotypic phase (i.e. the alignment of
              bases on a single DNA strand) is generally unobservable in
              multiply infected individuals. This manuscript describes an
              expectation maximization (EM) approach to maximum likelihood
              estimation of haplotype frequencies in this missing data setting.
              The approach is applied to a cohort of N=341 malaria infected
              children in Uganda, Cameroon and Sudan to characterize regional
              differences. A simulation study is also presented to characterize
              method performance and assess sensitivity to distributional
              assumptions.",
