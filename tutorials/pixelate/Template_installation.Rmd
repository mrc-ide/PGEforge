## Installing via the plasmogenepi R-universe

The fastest and simplest way to install *DRpower* is via the plasmogenepi R-universe as follows:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages('pixelate', repos = c('https://plasmogenepi.r-universe.dev', 'https://cloud.r-project.org'))
```

However, this may not work for some chips, in which case backup instructions are presented below.
