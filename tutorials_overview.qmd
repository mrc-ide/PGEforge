## Tutorial details

Some details of the various tutorials and the types of tools, eg simulation, analysis etc

*Note: we can create a 'listing' of all tutorials, more details [here](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-listings.html)*

For now, in the Tests menu option we have a test [R markdown (.rmd)](tutorials/tests/test_rmd.Rmd) and a [Python notebook (.ipynb)](tutorials/tests/test_python_notebook.ipynb) for demonstration purposes.
