The rOpenSci [R-universe system](https://ropensci.org/r-universe/) provides a framework for users and developers of R-packages to create a package 'ecosystem' in a **simple** and **accessible** way. The R-universe build infrastructure provides a high-performance package server, integrated monitoring tools, and REST APIs, including a front-end dashboard, to provide a dynamics and automated R package repository.

This infrastructure provides pre-built packages, which greatly simplifies installation of non-CRAN packages and those with complex dependencies such as C++ compilers. The R-universe platform is used by professionals from different industries including brain research, climate change, infectious disease research and government data analysis. If you are interested in learning more about the R-universe infrastructure, you can check out this [blog post](https://doi.org/10.59350/cq5fj-wj639) and we encourage you to explore the resources at the [rOpenSci R-universe website](https://ropensci.org/r-universe/) and the [R-universe dashboard](https://r-universe.dev/search/). 


### The [plasmogenepi.r-universe](https://plasmogenepi.r-universe.dev/builds)
The [PlasmoGenEpi](https://www.plasmogenepi.org) community has created a dedicated [plasmogenepi.r-universe](https://plasmogenepi.r-universe.dev/builds) with R packages relevant to *Plasmodium* genomic analyses. 

The dashboard build page can be seen below, where a timeline of updates to the packages is displayed as a bar chart, and below it the general information for each package, including links to the Github repository, who is the main maintaner of the package, and when it was last built.

You can navigate through to the 'Packages' tab for more detailed descriptions of each package, as seen below.

You can navigate through to the 'API' tab for more details on how to access the r-universe via its API, as seen below.

### Installation instructions

Having R packages within the R-universe ecosystem makes the installation process **much** simpler! This is an important aim of our community to ensure that the R packages available for analysis of *Plasmodium* genomic analysis are easily accessible to end-users. 



Below we show an example of how you could install the DRpower package via the [plasmogenepi.r-universe](https://plasmogenepi.r-universe.dev/DRpower).

```{r eval=F}
# Install 'DRpower' in R:
install.packages('DRpower', 
                 repos = c('https://plasmogenepi.r-universe.dev', 
                           'https://cloud.r-project.org'))
```

All the [tool tutorials](website_docs/tutorials_overview.qmd) in PGEforge have installation instructions, and where applicable, provide instructions for installation via the [plasmogenepi.r-universe](https://plasmogenepi.r-universe.dev/builds).
