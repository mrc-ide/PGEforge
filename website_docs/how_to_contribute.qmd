## The PGEforge vision
PGEforge is a **community-driven** platform created by and for malaria genomic epidemiology analysis tool developers and end-users. If you are interested in contributing to these efforts, please [get involved](how_to_contribute.qmd)!

## How to contribute to PGEforge
We are excited to have you join us and we welcome input from all areas of the research community to continuously improve and expand our platform. PGEforge aims to contribute to an inclusive and sustainable ecosystem of existing and new tools for *Plasmodium* genomic data analysis. From less to more involvement, there are several ways to get involved and join us in contributing to these aims. All contributors must adhere to our [community rules](#community-rules) and will be [recognized as a contributor](contributors.qmd). 

Below are some ways to get involved with current workstreams, but we also have some ideas and plans in the works for the [future](future_work.qmd) beyond what is currently available in PGEforge!

## Add tool to landscaping and software standards matrices
Landscaping, documenting and benchmarking available *Plasmodium* genomic data analysis tools and any tools within the realm of *Plasmodium* genomic epidemiology (PGE) will require continuous updating and curation. As new tools become available, they need to be assessed and integrated into our existing framework. While we have made significant progress in identifying, documenting and evaluating tools commonly applied to *Plasmodium* genetic data, the [tool landscaping](landscaping_matrix.qmd) and [evaluation against software standards](software_standards.qmd) is not exhaustive. For example, our initial efforts focused on tools for downstream *Plasmodium* genetic analysis, specifically targeting tools that extract signals from already processed data and focusing only on tools applicable *P. falciparum* and *P. vivax*. In terms of tool evaluation, we focused our efforts on evaluating the tools for which  resources were developed in the [tutorials section](tutorials_overview.qmd). [Future work](future_work.qmd) could also involve other types of tools, however.

:::{.column-margin}
So far, PGEforge hosts a landscaping matrix of 40 identified tools, full documentation and evaluation of 17 tools, and complete resources (summary documents, installation instructions, and fully-worked through tutorials) developed for 11 tools. 
:::

In order to ensure this 'live document' remains up-to-date, we encourage contributions to the following areas: 

- Updating the documentation and filling in the gaps for remaining tools in the [landscaping matrix](tool_landscaping.qmd)
- Evaluating remaining tools based on software standards (these tools are highlighted in grey in the [overview by tools based on software standards](tools_to_standards.qmd))
- Updating [tool scores against software standards](tools_to_standards.qmd) if developers release tool updates
- Add a **new** tool to landscaping and software standard matrices

To contribute to any of these areas, there are two ways to do this depending on your comfort level with using GitHub and R.

1. Download the relevant `.csv` files and edit them locally. Then open an [issue on Github](https://github.com/mrc-ide/PGEforge/issues/new) and attach your updated `.csv` files. The location of the files are described below: 

- [`MMS_software_landscaping.csv`](https://github.com/mrc-ide/PGEforge/tree/main/website_docs/tables/MMS_software_landscaping.csv): this is the [tool landscaping matrix](tool_landscaping.qmd). 
- [`Tools_to_standards.csv`](https://github.com/mrc-ide/PGEforge/tree/main/website_docs/tables/Tools_to_standards.csv): this is the evaluation of each tool with respect to the [objective software standards](software_standards.qmd). Please make sure you follow the [evaluation criteria rubric](https://mrc-ide.github.io/PGEforge/software_standards.qmd#evaluation-criteria) when you score each of the criteria. 

**Please ensure you only modify the relevant cells or add new rows as needed**

2. Follow the [Github contributor guidelines](#contributing-guidelines-for-github) to create your own branch and PR your changes directly. Make sure you:

- Add your headshot photo to the [`website_docs/img/people`](https://github.com/mrc-ide/PGEforge/tree/main/website_docs/img/people) folder
- Add your name in alphabetical order to the [website_docs/contributors.qmd](https://github.com/mrc-ide/PGEforge/blob/main/website_docs/contributors.qmd) and reference your photo by using the following code ```![](img/people/yourname.jpeg){fig-align="left" width="100px"}```.

## Develop resources for a tool

If you have developed a new *Plasmodium* genomic data analysis tool or identified a tool that is missing tutorial resources, you can develop them and contribute them to PGEforge! Follow these steps to contribute: 

:::{.column-margin}
Don't forget to also [add yourself as a contributor](#add-yourself-as-a-contributor)!

**Step 1:**
In PGEforge we focus on *Plasmodium* genomic **data analysis** tools. The tool should be within the scope of *Plasmodium* genomic epidemiology data analysis.

**Step 2:**
Take a look at the [tool landscaping](tool_landscaping.qmd) in case we have already evaluated that specific tool. In some instances, we opted to not develop tutorial resources for tools where there was difficulty installing and running the software, run-time errors, or if the tool was clearly superseded by more recent tools. You will find more details in the [tool landscaping](tool_landscaping.qmd). If you identify a tool that is not in the landscaping matrix, please [add it](#add-tool-to-landscaping-and-software-standards-matrices).

**Step 3:**
If you have reached this point and have found a tool that is missing from PGEforge, great! After [adding it to the landscaping and software standards matrices](#add-tool-to-landscaping-and-software-standards-matrices) you can develop the tool resources. We provide all the templates that you need to get started. For every tool, we develop the following resources:  

  - *Summary Document:* Provide an overview of the tool, including its main purpose, use cases, license, code repository, relevant publications, and citation details. Fill in these details in the template .csv file and then "Render" the accompanying .qmd file to display the information in a nicely formatted table. 
  - *Installation Instructions:* Write clear, step-by-step instructions for installing the tool, ensuring it is accessible to users with varying technical skills. If the tool is an R package and *not* already in the [PlasmoGenEpi R-universe](R_universe.qmd), please let us know! Otherwise, we strongly suggest you instruct users to install from R-universe.
  - *Fully Worked Tutorials:* Develop comprehensive tutorials that guide users through the entire process of using the tool to perform a specific analysis, from data import to interpretation of results. PGEforge hosts both empirical and simulated [canonical datasets](data_description.qmd) for the commonly used data input formats. We strongly encourage you to use these when you develop these tutorials as this ensures that they are fully reproducible. 

You can find the templates for all of these documents in our [Github repository](https://github.com/mrc-ide/PGEforge/tree/main/tutorials/Template) and example tutorials in the [Tutorials section](tutorials_overview.qmd).

**Please make sure to follow our [GitHub contribution guidelines](#contributing-guidelines-for-github).**
