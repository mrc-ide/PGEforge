The **R**eproducibility, **A**ccessibility, **D**ocumentation and **I**nter-operability **S**tandards **H**ackathon (**RADISH23**), organised by Bob Verity, Shazia Ruybal, Bryan Greenhouse and Amy Wesolowski will take place on Mon 11th Dec to Thurs 14th Dec 2023 in Baltimore, USA.

## Main aims

Our aim to take the wide range of software tools in malaria genomic epidemiology and make it so that more people can use them more reliably. This is a first step in working towards more ambitious goals like designing workflows, benchmarking, or coming up with guidelines for best practices.

## Tutorial development
Take a look at the [tutorial guidelines](tutorial_guidelines.qmd) for more details.
