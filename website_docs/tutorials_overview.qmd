## Overview
The aim of the PGEforge tutorials is to make the process of installing and using tools for *Plasmodium* genomic analyses as **straightforward** and **accessible** as possible. 

The following resources are available for each tool:

- A summary document detailing the main purpose and use cases, license, code repository, relevant publication(s), citation information and links to any additional resources
- Complete installation instructions
- A fully reproducible and worked-through tutorial showing example usage of the tool and its functionalities. This often uses the [canonical simulated or empirical datasets](data_description.qmd) as input data

## How to contribute

This is a live resource and we plan to continue adding to this as new tools become available! We hope this will grow into a common resource for analysis of malaria genetic data. 

If you are interested in contributing, there are [templates available](https://mrc-ide.github.io/PGEforge/tutorials/Template/Template_background.html) and [instructions](how_to_contribute.qmd) on how to get started.
